                            The Los Angeles Chargers barely missed out on the playoffs last year after losing to the Las Vegas Raiders in the final game of the 2021 season.
    Going into 2022, the Chargers are healthy and have a loaded offense ready to break out. Justin Herbert has the ability to turn into an MVP candidate with teammates he has grown with like Austin Ekeler, Keenan Allen, Mike Williams and Joshua Palmer.
    The defense added Khalil Mack and J.C. Jackson, though the cornerback will miss some time with an ankle injury. Joey Bosa and Asante Samuel Jr. are also back and will be looking to lock in and help Los Angeles get to the top of the AFC West.
