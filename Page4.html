        My favorite Football team (NFL) is the Los Angeles Chargers. I grew up watching them when they were in San Diego.
        My family has always been a fan of the Chiefs but back when I was young, I was watching the Chargers play the Cheifs and I knew that they were my favorite Team
        Ive been a Chargers fan since I first saw them play. Theres something about the team chemisrty and team colors that make me keep watching them
        They havent won the Super Bowl yet but they look really promising with the new QB, Justin Herbert
